# Picotest

Picotest is a minimal C89 unit test framework, consisting of a single header
file that defines 7 macros.

## Usage

A test is a function containing one or more ASSERT statements. If all such
statements evaluate to true, the test has passed. Tests are grouped into
suites, where each suite will evaluate the behaviour of one component of your
code. Each suite must be defined entirely in a single .c file (although .c
files can contain multiple suites.)


`DEF_TEST(test_name)` prologue that defines a test function.

`ASSERT(cond)` `cond` must evaluate to true for the test to have passed. If
any `cond`s evaluate to false, the test function is said to have failed.

`DEF_SUITE(suite_name)` defines a suite of tests.

`RUN_TEST(test_name)` must appear in the body of a DEF_SUITE. It runs the test
of the given name.

```c
DEF_TEST(returns_length_of_a_string)
{
    ASSERT(len("alfa") == 4);
    ASSERT(len("bravo") == 5);
    ASSERT(len("charlie") == 7);
}

DEF_TEST(returns_length_of_an_empty_string)
{
    ASSERT(len("") == 0);
}

DEF_SUITE(strlen)
{
    RUN_TEST(returns_length_of_a_string);
    RUN_TEST(returns_length_of_an_empty_string);
}
```

A test runner is required to run the test suites.

`IMPORT_SUITE(suite_name)` imports the suite of the given name into the test
runner scope.

`BEGIN_TESTS()` must be called to initialise the test run (and to declare the
`passes` and `failures` variables.)

`RUN_SUITE(suite_name)` executes the given suite, which must previously have
been imported with `IMPORT_SUITE`. 

After all tests are runs, `passes` will contain the number of tests that have
passed, and `failures` the number that have failed.

```c
IMPORT_SUITE(strlen);
IMPORT_SUITE(reverse);

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    BEGIN_TESTS();
    RUN_SUITE(strlen);
    RUN_SUITE(reverse);

    printf("\n%i PASSED\n%i FAILED\n", passes, failures);
    return failures == 0 ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```
